---------------------
The key contributions are
* combination of the ansatz of the variational multiscale method with domain decomposition and model order reduction techniques to develop a method suitable to model linear elastic heterogeneous structures,
* construction of fine scale edge basis functions via solution of an oversampling problem with random boundary conditions, where a global reduced problem is
used to inform the boundary conditions such that the random boundary values are correlated and incorporate the displacement state of the structure of interest into the
construction of the local reduced space. This sampling approach is compared to the approach using fully
uncorrelated samples in the solution of the oversampling problem, 
* extension of fine scale edge basis functions into (mesoscale) subdomains, such that subdomains can be coupled in a conforming way ensuring continuity of the displacement field.
