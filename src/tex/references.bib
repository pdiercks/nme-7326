 title = {Optimal Local Approximation Spaces for Component-Based Static Condensation Procedures},
 abstract = {In this paper we introduce local approximation spaces for component-based static condensation (sc) procedures that are optimal in the sense of Kolmogorov. To facilitate simulations for large structures such as aircrafts or ships, it is crucial to decrease the number of degrees of freedom on the interfaces, or {"}ports{"}, in order to reduce the size of the statically condensed system. To derive optimal port spaces we consider a (compact) transfer operator that acts on the space of harmonic extensions on a two-component system and maps the traces on the ports that lie on the boundary of these components to the trace of the shared port. Solving the eigenproblem for the composition of the transfer operator and its adjoint yields the optimal space. For a related work in the context of the generalized finite element method we refer to [I. Babuska and R. Lipton, Optimal local approximation spaces for generalized finite element methods with application to multiscale problems, Multiscale Model. Simul., 9 (2011), pp. 373-406]. We further introduce a spectral greedy algorithm to generalize the procedure to the parameter-dependent setting and to construct a quasi-optimal parameter-independent port space. Moreover, it is shown that given a certain tolerance and an upper bound for the ports in the system, the spectral greedy constructs a port space that yields a sc approximation error on a system of arbitrary configuration which is smaller than this tolerance for all parameters in a rich train set. We present our approach for isotropic linear elasticity although the idea may be readily applied to any linear coercive problem.Numerical experiments demonstrate the very rapid and exponential convergence both of the eigenvalues and the sc approximation based on spectral modes for non-separable and irregular geometries such as an I-Beam with an internal crack.},

@article{Unger2011a,

 abstract = {In this paper, a mesoscale model of concrete is presented, which considers particles, matrix material and the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) as separate constituents. Particles are represented as ellipsoides, generated according to a prescribed grading curve and placed randomly into the specimen. Algorithms are proposed to generate realistic particle configurations efficiently. The nonlinear behavior is simulated with a cohesive interface model for the ITZ. For the matrix material, different damage/plasticity models are investigated. The simulation of localization requires to regularize the solution, which is performed by using integral type nonlocal models with strain or displacement averaging. Due to the complexity of a mesoscale model for a realistic structure, a multiscale method to couple the homogeneous macroscale with the heterogeneous mesoscale model in a concurrent embedded approach is proposed. This allows an adaptive transition from a full macroscale model to a multiscale model, where only the relevant parts are resolved on a finer scale. Special emphasis is placed on the investigation of different coupling schemes between the different scales, such as the mortar method and the arlequin method, and a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages within the current context. The applicability of the proposed methodology is illustrated for a variety of examples in tension and compression. {\copyright } 2011 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.},

 abstract = {Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a widely used technique for the construction of low-dimensional approximation spaces from high-dimensional input data. For large-scale applications and an increasing number of input data vectors, however, computing the POD often becomes prohibitively expensive. This work presents a general, easy-to-implement approach to compute an approximate POD based on arbitrary tree hierarchies of worker nodes, where each worker computes a POD of only a small number of input vectors. The tree hierarchy can be freely adapted to optimally suit the available computational resources. In particular, this hierarchical approximate POD (HAPOD) allows for both simple parallelization with low communication overhead, as well as incremental POD computation under constrained memory capacities. Rigorous error estimates ensure the reliability of our approach, and extensive numerical examples underline its performance.},

 abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing small strains. Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including elastic--plastic deformations of composite materials.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new multi-scale method for the homogenization analysis of hyperelastic solids undergoing finite strains. The key contribution is to use an incremental nonlinear homogenization technique in tandem with a model reduction method, in order to alleviate the complexity of multiscale procedures, which usually involve a large number of nonlinear nested problems to be solved. The problem associated with the representative volume element (RVE) is solved via a model reduction method (proper orthogonal decomposition). The reduced basis is obtained through pre-computations on the RVE. The technique, coined as reduced model multiscale method (R3M), allows reducing significantly the computation times, as no large matrix needs to be inverted, and as the convergence of both macro and micro problems is enhanced. Furthermore, the R3M drastically reduces the size of the data base describing the history of the micro problems. In order to validate the technique in the context of porous elastomers at finite strains, a comparison between a full and a reduced multiscale analysis is performed through numerical examples, involving different micro and macro structures, as well as different nonlinear models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin). It is shown that the R3M gives good agreement with the full simulations, at lower computational and data storage requirements.},

 abstract = {Abstract A novel model-order reduction technique for the solution of the fine-scale equilibrium problem appearing in computational homogenization is presented. The reduced set of empirical shape functions is obtained using a partitioned version --- that accounts for the elastic/inelastic character of the solution --- of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). On the other hand, it is shown that the standard approach of replacing the nonaffine term by an interpolant constructed using only POD modes leads to ill-posed formulations. We demonstrate that this ill-posedness can be avoided by enriching the approximation space with the span of the gradient of the empirical shape functions. Furthermore, interpolation points are chosen guided, not only by accuracy requirements, but also by stability considerations. The approach is assessed in the homogenization of a highly complex porous metal material. Computed results show that computational complexity is independent of the size and geometrical complexity of the Representative Volume Element. The speedup factor is over three orders of magnitude --- as compared with finite element analysis --- whereas the maximum error in stresses is less than 10.},
